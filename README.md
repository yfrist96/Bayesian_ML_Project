# Bayesian_ML_Project
Generative &amp; Discriminative Classification of Images

In this project I used a Quadratic discriminant Analysis (QDA) and a Bayesian Linear Regression model to classify between images of dogs and frogs (both datasets can be found at https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ekriz/cifar.html and contain 6000 images - 5750 for training and 250 for testing).
